Favourites
==========

This menu is customizable. When you click "Manage Favourite Tools" menu entry, a dialog will appear. You can add your custom tools to the menu, and also assign hotkeys to them. By default the path of the tool or script will appear in the menu, but if you set description of it, the description will appear in the menu instead. If you add ``%PID%`` in the command line of a tool, it will be replaced with the PID of the debuggee (or 0 if not debugging).

Currently, three types of entries may be inserted into this menu: Tool, Script and Command.
