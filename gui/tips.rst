Tips
====
This section contains some useful tips about the user interface of this program.

Modules view
------------

The modules view is inside the symbols view.

Relative Addressing
-------------------
If you double-click the address column, then relative addressing will be used. The address column will show the relative address relative to the double-clicked address.

Tables
------

You can reorder and hide any column by right-clicking, middle-clicking or double-clicking on the header. Alternatively, you can drag one column header to another one to exchange their order.

Highlight mode
--------------

Don't know how to hightlight a register? Press Ctrl+H (or click "Highlight mode" menu on the disassembly view). When the red border is shown, click on the register(or command, immediate or any token), then that token will be hightlighted with an underline.

Code page
---------

You can use the codepage dialog(in the context menu of the dump view) to select a code page. UTF-16LE is the codepage that matches windows unicode encoding. You can use UTF-16LE code page to view strings in a unicode application.

Change Window Title
-------------------

You can rename the windows of x64dbg by renaming "x64dbg.exe" or "x32dbg.exe" to another name. You should also rename the "x64dbg.ini" or "x32dbg.ini" to keep it the same name as the debugger.
